# Pattern-Recognition-with-Feedforward-Neural-Networks-

This repository encompasses MATLAB codes developed for the analysis of cancer, crab, and iris datasets. Each dataset is processed with distinct neural network configurations, featuring varying numbers of neurons in the input, output, and hidden layers. Included below are sample neural networks, confusion matrices, and training loss curves, providing comprehensive insights into the analysis outcomes.
